# Maine CD2 2018 Election Re-creation

The primary purpose of this project is to maintain newly acquired skills in
Python and Pandas over a school holiday. To do so, this project will take data
from the 2018 election in Maine's Second Congressional District and recreate
the ranked choice voting algorithm used to declare Jared Golden the Congressman-
Elect.
