# Maine CD2 2018 Election Re-creation

The primary purpose of this project is to maintain newly acquired skills in
Python and Pandas over a school holiday. To do so, this project will take data
from the 2018 election in Maine's Second Congressional District and recreate
the ranked choice voting algorithm used to declare Jared Golden the Congressman-Elect.

Data acquired from: https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/results/results18.html#Nov6

Current status: Produces correct results



To-do: implement tie-breaker (not necessary for this specific election but good practice); check documentation; code review



Ideas for future implementation: downloading this data and converting to csv with a script; showing transfer of votes between candidates
